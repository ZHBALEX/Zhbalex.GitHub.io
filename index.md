## About Me

I am a master’s student focusing on 
[Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)](https://engineering.jhu.edu/fsag/) 
combined with 
[biofluid mechanics](https://engineering.jhu.edu/fsag/research/) 
at **Johns Hopkins University** in the 
[FPCL](https://engineering.jhu.edu/fsag/), 
where I am fortunate to be advised by 
[Dr. Rajat Mittal](https://me.jhu.edu/faculty/rajat-mittal/) and 
[Dr. Jung-Hee Seo](https://engineering.jhu.edu/fsag/people/faculty/jung_hee_seo/). 
My current research focuses on **pancreatic duct flow** and the development of integrated computational tools to help identify chronic pancreatitis caused by **hypertension**, aiming to create a better future for patients.

I completed my bachelor’s degree at 
[Southern Illinois University](https://siu.edu) and 
[Shenyang Aerospace University](https://en.sau.edu.cn), 
specializing in **Aircraft Powerplant Engineering**.


## Research Interests

My research interests focus on applying computational algorithms to real-world problems, particularly in fluid dynamics, biofluids, and aerodynamics.

- **Computational Fluid Dynamics:** Numerical schemes and algorithms, CFD applications.
- **Biological Fluid Dynamics:** Physiological fluids, pancreatic duct flow
- **Machine Learning:** Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), geometric encoders, and multi-geometry PINNs.
