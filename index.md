## About Me


WARNING: This Page is still under constuction

I am a master's student focusing on Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) combined with biofluid mechanics at Johns Hopkins University, under the guidance of Dr. Rajat Mittal and Dr. Jung-Hee Seo.



I completed my bachelor's degree at Southern Illinois University and Shenyang Aerospace University, where I specialized in Aircraft Powerplant Engineering.


## Research Interests

My research interests include applying computational algorithms to real-world problems, particularly in fluid dynamics, biofluids, and aerodynamics.


- **Computation Fluid Dynamcis:** Numerical 
- **Machine Learning:** meta-learning, incremental learning, transfer learning



## Current Research 

My current research involves theoretical and numerical modeling of Pancreatic Duct flows.
