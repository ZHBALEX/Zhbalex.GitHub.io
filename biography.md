<!-- I received my PhD in computer science at [Max Planck Institute for Informatics](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/), where I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Bernt Schiele](https://people.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~schiele/) and [Prof. Qianru Sun](https://qianrusun.com/). As part of the [European Laboratory for Learning and Intelligent Systems (ELLIS) PhD Program](https://ellis.eu/phd-postdoc), I was also co-supervised by [Prof. Christian Rupprecht](https://chrirupp.github.io/) and [Prof. Andrea Vedaldi](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vedaldi/) in the [Visual Geometry Group (VGG)](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/) at the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/). I obtained my BS in electronic information engineering from [Tianjin University](http://www.tju.edu.cn/english/index.htm). I was a postdoctoral fellow at [Johns Hopkins University](https://cs.jhu.edu), working with [Prof. Alan L. Yuille](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~ayuille/). I was also a research intern at the [National University of Singapore](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/), working with [Prof. Tat-Seng Chua](https://www.chuatatseng.com/) and [Prof. Qianru Sun](https://qianrusun.com/). -->


<!-- ## About Me -->

I am a master’s student focusing on 
[Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)](https://engineering.jhu.edu/fsag/) 
combined with 
[biofluid mechanics](https://engineering.jhu.edu/fsag/research/) 
at Johns Hopkins University in the 
[FPCL](https://engineering.jhu.edu/fsag/), 
where I am fortunate to be advised by 
[Dr. Rajat Mittal](https://me.jhu.edu/faculty/rajat-mittal/) and 
[Dr. Jung-Hee Seo](https://engineering.jhu.edu/fsag/people/faculty/jung_hee_seo/). 
My current research focuses on pancreatic duct flow and the development of integrated computational tools to help identify chronic pancreatitis caused by hypertension, aiming to create a better future for patients.

I completed my bachelor’s degree at 
[Southern Illinois University](https://siu.edu) and 
[Shenyang Aerospace University](https://en.sau.edu.cn), 
specializing in Aircraft Powerplant Engineering. My studies included fluid dynamics, energy systems, and mechanical engineering. I also gained hands-on experience in the assembly, maintenance, and design of propulsion engines.
