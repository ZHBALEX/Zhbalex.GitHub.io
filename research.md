## Pancreatic Duct FLow 
We developed a **non-invasive** diagnostic method for **chronic pancreatitis** by integrating ERCP data with **CFD** to predict pancreatic ductal **hypertension**. This involved reconstructing 3D MRI models, setting flow-based boundary conditions, and validating pressure distributions with clinical data. Additionally, we created an analytical model and automated the **imaging-to-pressure workflow** using advanced toolkits and PINNs, enhancing accuracy across diverse anatomies. Presented at the

, our work highlights CFD’s crucial role in advancing diagnostics and improving patient outcomes.

### From PD Flow to CFD

Our research focused on pancreatic duct flow to create a diagnostic tool for chronic pancreatitis. We reconstructed 3D models from MRI data, applied flow-based boundary conditions, remeshed complex geometries, and conducted CFD simulations to map pressure distributions. Validation against clinical and experimental data demonstrated a high correlation, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.

### From CFD to Analytical Solution

Beyond simulations, we developed an analytical model for pressure drop prediction using a quasi-one-dimensional approach derived from the Navier–Stokes equations. We automated the workflow from medical imaging to pressure prediction with tools like the Vascular Modeling Toolkit and NeuroMorph for geometric parameter extraction. To enhance accuracy, we integrated physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) with encoder-decoder architectures, capturing nonlinear flux components and accommodating diverse anatomical geometries. This interdisciplinary research, presented at the
